1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,450
SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

2
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,150
Purified Blood of the Demon Monarch.

3
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,310
Now I have everything I need.

4
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,090
The rate of success and quantity
depend on intelligence level?

5
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,270
Jinwoo, are you alright?

6
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
Craft.

7
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,990
The Elixir of Life is complete.

8
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,280
But, will this cure
my mother's Eternal Slumber?

9
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,870
Iron, you're unusually
quick-witted today.

10
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,850
Arise.

11
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,010
The name...

12
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,520
Kesslin... Kekalin...

13
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,820
What was its name again?

14
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,690
Jinwoo, you're terrible
at remembering names.

15
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,780
Well, whatever.

16
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,280
Your name...

17
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,910
...shall be 'Kaisel.'

18
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,000
With this dragon,
we'll return home in no time.

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,170
Let's hold a party when we return!

20
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,150
My father will be delighted!

21
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,550
- Umm...
- I want to test

22
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,300
- Hey!
- the elixir's effects immediately.

23
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,850
Are you listening?

24
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,520
- We're having a party!
- Right, there's a rune stone in the reward.

25
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,720
A joyous party!

26
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,430
No...

27
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,230
Not this either.

28
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,520
Ermm...

29
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,730
Ah, here it is.

30
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,740
Shadow Exchange...

31
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,830
Does this mean I can switch places with
my Shadow Soldiers wherever they are?

32
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,120
In that case...

33
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,790
Sorry, Esil, you go back alone.

34
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,420
Huh? What about the party?

35
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,170
The Radis family lives on the 80th floor.

36
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,050
It's too far for a detour.

37
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,640
No way...

38
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,390
Let's meet again if fate allows.

39
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,980
Take care.

40
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,600
Jinwoo, I...

41
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,180
Hmm?

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,810
Huh?

43
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,220
I really switched places
with the patrol soldiers.

44
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,950
It takes three hours
before I can reuse it.

45
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,750
Then the remaining journey...

46
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,250
Kaisel.

47
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,340
We'll use Hunters' magical power as bait
to lure out the ants.

48
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,100
Then use special interference waves
to disrupt their sensory communication.

49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,690
The special forces will seize
this chance to infiltrate the nest

50
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,310
and eliminate the queen ant, huh?

51
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,400
The issue is whether the interference
waves will work properly.

52
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,200
It'd be a lie to say I don't feel uneasy.

53
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,120
However the investigation results are accurate,
and the conclusions align with ours.

54
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,750
We've also established a retreat plan
if the interference wave fails.

55
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,590
What we should do...

56
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,880
...is to make thorough preparations
to send Hunters to that island.

57
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,290
Yes.

58
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,010
Additionally...

59
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,970
Have you been able
to contact Hunter Sung?

60
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,520
Not yet.

61
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,770
Yoonho.

62
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,440
We rarely go drinking, so cheer up.

63
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,110
That was funny, wasn't it?

64
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,860
Byung-Gu, I don't understand at all.

65
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,450
Frowning will make you age faster.

66
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,740
Mind your own business!

67
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,260
S-Rank healer, Min Byung-Gu.

68
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,000
He is one of the few Hunters in the world
who retired young with all limbs intact.

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,550
He's also my life-and-death companion.

70
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,880
Just like his weird sense of humor,
he remains an eccentric.

71
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,760
Since when are you so tactful?

72
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,720
Yoonho.

73
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,140
Are you really going?

74
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,020
Yeah.

75
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,110
You saw how Eunseok died.

76
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,220
That's exactly why I must go.

77
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,580
If we let those ants run wild,
the whole country will soon become like that.

78
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,870
Since when were you so patriotic?

79
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,670
I have to go either way,
so I might as well do it for a good reason.

80
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,050
He said the same thing just like you.

81
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,020
I'm not going. Never.

82
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,810
If you came to invite me, thenâ€”

83
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,680
I came to say goodbye.

84
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,940
I might not be able to see you again.

85
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,900
I plan to take the civil service exam.

86
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,570
The civil service exam?

87
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,030
I don't want to see any more blood.

88
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,470
That's why I want to be a civil servant.

89
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,230
But I'm only good at history.

90
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,460
So the exam might be tough.

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,960
Are you good at history?

92
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,960
You know how much
I love historical dramas, right?

93
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,170
Do you?

94
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,150
But that's how normal life should be.

95
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,720
Battles should remain confined to history.

96
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,720
Yes, you are right.

97
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,810
It's Hunters who are not normal.

98
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,850
Come to think of it,

99
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,320
I haven't met many Hunters
who hate fighting magic beasts.

100
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,280
Fighting has become routine now.

101
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,030
Some even enjoy it...

102
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,950
Could it be, that's the condition
for awakening...

103
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,030
Yoonho.

104
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,000
You're frowning again.

105
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,460
Shut up and drink!

106
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,790
Very sly, Your Excellency.

107
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,380
Why are you speaking like that?

108
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,780
That burn mark was my fault.

109
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,090
She might not be able to drink it.

110
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,300
Even if she does,
no one knows what will happen.

111
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,010
But...

112
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,770
I've witnessed countless miracles
from the system.

113
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,000
Including that I grew so much
from E-Rank.

114
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,690
I'll trust it.

115
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,290
Mom.

116
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,340
Please open your eyes.

117
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,430
I keep fighting and growing for you.

118
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,520
Please wake up...

119
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,310
Mom...

120
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,460
I couldn't focus all day...
Why is that?

121
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,650
The wind feels warm.

122
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,110
You're Jinwoo...

123
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,390
Right?

124
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,800
How long was I asleep?

125
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,290
Four years.

126
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,870
You slept for four years.

127
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,500
How is Jinah?

128
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,640
She's good.

129
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,390
Thank you, Jinwoo.

130
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,100
You kept your promise.

131
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,020
You've become so mature.

132
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,870
But you're covered in wounds.

133
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,950
You must have pushed
yourself too hard, right?

134
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,310
It must have been tough for you.

135
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,960
It's nothing...

136
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm fine...

137
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,660
I'm fine...

138
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,560
Thank you.

139
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,760
Jinwoo.

140
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes...

141
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,990
The patient with Eternal Slumber
has awoken?!

142
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,370
Yes, I know it's hard to believe.

143
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,500
Moreover, the patient's body
shows no abnormalities.

144
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,630
The patient and their family
want to be discharged immediately.

145
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,050
Jinah, you've grown so much.

146
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,660
Mom...

147
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,670
I'm sorry for worrying you.

148
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,170
All my efforts have been rewarded.

149
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,430
I've finally received the real reward.

150
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,130
Thank you all for gathering here today.

151
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,670
As you all know,
disasters are now occurring nationwide

152
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,010
due to winged ant magic beasts
from Jeju Island.

153
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,300
In response to this situation,
the Hunter's Association...

154
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,510
...has decided to initiate
the "4th Jeju Island Raid Mission."

155
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,220
This operation will involve
not only domestic S-Rank Hunters

156
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,400
but also 10 S-Rank Hunters from Japan.

157
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,980
Hunters of A-Rank and below

158
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,940
will handle maritime surveillance
and homeland defense

159
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,330
to jointly support this operation
and protect other members.

160
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,250
This time, we are determined to succeed.

161
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,050
Eunseok...

162
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,710
To be honest, I'm scared.

163
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,970
Me too.

164
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,600
But those who can't fight
must be far more scared than us.

165
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,020
We'll end this.

166
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,100
This is something only
we can accomplish.

167
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,860
We can't let this country
become an ant nest.

168
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,320
Darn it!

169
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,350
I'll crush those things
with my bare hands...

170
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,570
Yoonho is someone to worry about.

171
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,160
Both in personality and abilities.

172
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,050
The only ones who can help him
at critical times...

173
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,160
...are you and me.

174
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,930
Hey...

175
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,820
You do indulge yourself when I'm away.

176
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,560
Alright, let's start
our first cleaning in four years.

177
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,370
The three of us will do it together.

178
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,980
This house has aged quite a bit.

179
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,190
The grime won't come off easily.

180
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,410
After all, we've lived here
since I was born.

181
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,200
You're right.

182
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,260
This is the scene I've longed for.

183
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,080
But...

184
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,180
My heart is filled with unease.

185
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,670
While being a Hunter...

186
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,630
...did I cross a line
that should never be crossed?

187
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,440
Jinwoo.

188
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,390
Huh? What is it?

189
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,600
Has your father contacted you?

190
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,480
By the way, I saw the news.

191
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,530
That you became a Hunter.

192
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,150
Mhm.

193
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,510
Your father was a firefighter
before becoming a Hunter.

194
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,740
I married him because I thought
he looked cool when saving lives.

195
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,010
You've inherited his trait.

196
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,290
I'm also trying to become a doctor
to heal people.

197
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,670
Yes, that's right.

198
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,380
Jinah, you've inherited it too.

199
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
Right?

200
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,920
Hello?

201
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,010
Phew...

202
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,390
You handled the press conference well.

203
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,680
Yeah.

204
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
Thank you for attending as well.

205
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,000
It's nothing.

206
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,150
I didn't expect him to visit
after the press conference.

207
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,770
Thomas Andre.

208
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,800
He's the America's S-Rank
national authority Hunter.

209
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,530
I half-expected him to come help.

210
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,740
Given the timing,
it was reasonable.

211
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,080
But someone with power
tantamount to the national military

212
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,250
usually wouldn't intervene
in a foreign country's operations.

213
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,340
True.

214
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,000
But then, why would he...

215
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,930
Maybe as he claimed,
he was just passing through.

216
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,600
He may have come to intimidate us
regarding Hunter Hwang

217
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,720
or to verify something.

218
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,770
Is Hunter Sung still unreachable?

219
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,480
No, we just contacted him.

220
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,360
He should arrive soon.

221
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,570
We'll depart in four days.

222
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,910
This raid mission has been
our long-cherished goal.

223
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,120
Will you lend us your strength?

224
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,410
It's a prime opportunity for leveling up.

225
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,880
A pity to pass up.

226
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,840
I would've thought so before.

227
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,620
I...

228
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,210
Magical power waves?!

229
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,120
It's truly impressive that you can
sense it from this distance.

230
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,390
The S-Rank Hunters are
warming up at the gymnasium.

231
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,400
If you're interested,
you can go take a look.

232
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,830
Instructor Baek!

233
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,090
You're still young, so shouldn't you work on
strengthening your legs and back a bit more?

234
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,840
I'm just an office worker now,
Instructor Ma!

235
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,630
S-Rank Hunters rarely gather like this.

236
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,890
The magical power wave earlier
must have been from them.

237
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,770
Hunter Baek is being pushed back.

238
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,480
If President Baek goes all out,
Hunter Ma probably couldn't withstand it.

239
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,070
Hello.

240
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,080
The person wearing the dobok
is Ma Dongwook from the Fame Guild.

241
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,240
Why isn't he using full strength?

242
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,620
The opponent doesn't seem like someone
he needs to hold back against.

243
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,000
It's undesirable to show his true power
in front of so many people.

244
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,710
When he fights at full power,
he becomes a real monster.

245
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,840
So the rumors about
the transformation-type Hunter are true.

246
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,220
Also, those people over there
are from the Knights Guild...

247
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,220
Oh?

248
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,100
They've come too.

249
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:31,570
They're Japan's S-Rank Hunters
and Guild Master Goto Ryuji.

250
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,280
Hmm? Who's that?

251
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,700
Ah...

252
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,570
That's Hunter Sung Jinwoo,
who recently became an S-Rank Hunter.

253
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,490
Seems to be a highly capable Assassin.

254
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,500
No. He's a Mage.

255
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,830
A Mage?

256
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,710
Oh?

257
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,300
Isn't that Hunter Sung
who embarrassed our Minsung?

258
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,790
No wonder the atmosphere here changed.

259
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,730
So they are this country's top forces.

260
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,900
Somewhat disappointing.

261
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,610
Maybe because I'm always
watching Mr. Goto's battles,

262
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,900
they don't look like
S-Rank to me at all.

263
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,530
It's too early to judge.

264
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,740
I can't let that comment slide.

265
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,160
Miss Translator.

266
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,450
You were mocking us just now, weren't you?

267
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,500
I can tell even if it's in Japanese.

268
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,080
Brilliant, Guild Master!

269
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,460
You are...

270
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,540
This is the Guild Master
of the Knights Guild,

271
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,340
Mr. Park Jongsoo.

272
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,630
Park Jongsoo?

273
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,010
Never heard of him.

274
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,010
The Master is an A-Rank Hunter,
not an S-Rank Hunter.

275
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,100
That's probably why.

276
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,140
But we're still one of
the top five guilds in the country.

277
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,390
- During this raid mission...
- What are you doing?

278
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,900
You'd better not cause trouble.

279
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,270
They're the ones saying we're weak.

280
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,490
Alright, calm down.

281
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,690
Good timing.

282
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,610
Since everyone's here,
let's hold a friendly match.

283
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,400
Only S-Rank Hunters will participate.

284
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,160
Are you excluding me?!

285
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,470
You can decide the rules of the match.

286
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,290
That sounds good.

287
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,300
However, Mages are hard to judge in strength,
and non-combat Hunters should be excluded.

288
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,840
No problem.

289
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,430
Then only combat-type Hunters
can participate.

290
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,430
Being grabbed at the wrists,
touched on the back,

291
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,140
and falling to the floor
will be considered a loss.

292
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,350
The match won't be one-on-one.

293
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,310
We all go together.

294
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,780
It'll be chaotic on the island anyway.

295
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,530
I understand.

296
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,700
Let's do that then.

297
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Our participants will be:

298
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,290
Hunter Cha, Hunter Lim,
Hunter Ma, and Hunter Baek.

299
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,250
Ours will be:
Tawata, Kumamoto, Hoshino, and Tanaka.

300
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,930
Then, let the friendly match begin.

301
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,720
SOLO LEVELING

302
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,220
EPISODE 21: IT WAS ALL WORTH IT

303
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,980
EPISODE 22: WE NEED A HERO
