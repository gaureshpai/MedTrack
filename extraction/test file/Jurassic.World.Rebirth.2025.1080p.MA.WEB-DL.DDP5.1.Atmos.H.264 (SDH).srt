Well...

178
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,650
I'm gonna need a number.

179
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,819
Ten, six zeros.

180
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,022
Including the one
that's in the ten?

181
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,590
No.

182
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,860
It's a fortune, Ms. Bennett.

183
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,762
The kind of money that would
mean you'd never have to put

184
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,065
your life on the line
ever again.

185

186
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,034
All right, what's the hitch?

187
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,669
Uh... (clears throat)

188
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,104
Possible criminal charges.

189
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,106
We are going to a place

190

where every government on
the planet has outlawed travel.

191
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,147
Well, we better not
tell anyone, then.

192
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,052
Yeah, that might be a problem.

193
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:49,056

00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,935
Can we have a word?

Dr. Henry Loomis, Zora Bennett,

215
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,208
-our mission specialist.
-Hello.

216
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,011
Sorry, what mission?

217
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:47,047
Uh, guys, why don't
you just take a break

218
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,283
-for a minute, okay?
-(chuckles)

219
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,951
LOOMIS:
Thanks, guys.

220
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,953
Dr. Loomis has been
advising ParkerGenix

221
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,055
for the past six months
on paleo-coronary health.

222
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,924
We're developing a new drug,
Paleodioxin,

223
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,760
derived from the largest
dinosaur species on record.

224
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,096
Computer modeling suggests
it could forestall

225
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,865
coronary disease
by an average of two decades.

226
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,034
Think what that might have
meant for your mother.

227
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,136
-I'm so sorry for your loss.
-(chuckles): Okay.

228
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:09,970
Anybody can read a file.

229
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:12,306
If you get personal, though,
I'm out.

230
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,008
I'm sorry for
overstepping.

231
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,243
This, uh, research is crucial.

232
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:17,945
We just can't get it to trial.

233
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,914
We're unable
to synthesize the DNA,

234
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:22,183
so we need samples
from living dinosaurs.

235
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,319
And the species must be
a true colossus.

236
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,721
It's the biggest animals
across three categories:

237
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:30,491
seagoing, land based and avian.

238
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,359
Why the biggest?

239
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,161
Oh, it's their hearts.

240
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:37,231
The bigger they were, the
bigger their coronary muscles.

241
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,933
And they lived
the longest,

242
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:42,136
over a hundred years for
some Cretaceous-era sauropods.

243
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:47,041
Which means the three
dinosaurs they need are

244
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:52,479
Mosasaurus,
which lives in the ocean,

245
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:56,016
and Titanosaurus.

246
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,752
You'll find them on land.

247
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:03,891
And in the sky, Quetzalcoatlus.

248
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,493
It's the largest
pterosaur.

249
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:08,095
Each of them had
an average lifespan

250
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,497
of well over a century,
even before DNA refinement.

251
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:12,099
ZORA:
Mm.

252
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,367
A drug that could prevent
heart disease would be

253
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,269
the biggest medical breakthrough
in centuries.

254
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:19,541
Yeah. And I'm sure it'd be
worth billions, right?

255
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:21,242
-Trillions.
-Hmm.

256
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,444
The only way for our scientists
to complete the strands now

257
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:28,048
is with blood and tissue samples
from living dinosaurs.

258
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,784
Wait. Y-You want
to take blood samples

259
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,786
from these animals
while they're alive?

260
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,322
Hemoglobin deoxygenates
within seconds postmortem.

261
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:39,793
Lividity and hypostasis
follow immediately.

262
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,896
Fortunately for us,
all these species exist

263
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,032
in one isolated location.

264
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,300
We're putting together a team,

265
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,269
and we'd like
to leave immediately.

266
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,270
We have competitors,

267
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:52,540
and Mr. Parker does not
tolerate second place.

268
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,141
Can you be ready tomorrow?

269
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,076
Dr. Loomis?

270
00:12:58,412 --> 00:12:59,880
I thought I was just advising.

271
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,949
You are. In person.

272
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,285
We're not qualified
to identify the animals

273
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,287
or predict behavior.

274
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,788
Well... (chuckles)

275
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,425
Why don't you
send an army?

276
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,560
You're a rich company.

277
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:14,328
Confidentiality.

278
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,164
The fewer people know
about this, the better.

279
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,999
I can guarantee your safety.

280
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,568
I mean, you know, more or less.

281
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:22,903
Oh, no, no. It's not about
my safety. It's just, it's...

282
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,072
-"More or less"?
-Yeah.

283
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:32,179
(hushed): What you're proposing
is really illegal.

284
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,015
Oh, did we-- did you tell him
about the zeros?

285
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,083
That's not gonna work with him.

286
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,118

talking about?

(scoffs)

288
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:43,991
You ever seen a dinosaur
in the wild?

289
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,060
I don't mean in a theme park
when you were a kid

290
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:50,030
or watching some poor creature
wander around town lost.

291
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:53,000

354
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:24,144
Why don't you make some sort
of good faith gesture?

355
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,848
Like, maybe-- you know,
I'm just spitballing here--

356
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:29,216
but maybe you could

357
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,552
double the number
that you and I spoke about,

358
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,185
and then I can
take care of Duncan

359
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,588
and his crew
out of my end.

360
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:35,489
KREBS:
Oh, I see.

361
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,491
(chuckles):
That's very nice.

362
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,326
You guys cook this up
on the phone or just now?

363
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,829
Oh, I'm just trying
to help you out.

364
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:43,765
I don't have to sit here
and be insulted.

365
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:46,300
For God sakes, fine. Agreed.

366
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,435
-Great.
-Great. (sighs)

367
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,706
We'll loop up toward Barbados

368
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:56,209
to avoid government patrols,
but there aren't many anyway.

369
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,647
Why's that?

370
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:03,183
(laughs)

371
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,620
No one's dumb enough
to go where we're going.

372
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:08,188
(kids chattering,
laughing)

373
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,324
(chuckles):
Hey! Hey!

374
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,827
-Come here! (grunts)
-(dinosaur roaring on TV)

375
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,194
-Hey.
-ATWATER: Hey.

376
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,362
Over here.

377
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,831
-Hey, Z.
-(chuckles): Hi.

378
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,766
-Hey, how you been?
-Oh, good.

379
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,467
KINCAID:
Bobby Atwater.

380
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,503
He'll be helping
with team security.

381
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:24,271
Security for...?

382
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,674
Make sure you don't end up
in one of these.

383
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,281
A live one.

384
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,851
Is there anything else?

385
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:39,319
Yeah, listen, I'm not
gonna be able to do this, you
know?

386
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,221
I-I would love to as a favor
for you, Z, but...

387
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,524
-Oh, no, we ran it already.
-All right, cool.

388
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,160
So, when we leaving?

389
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,429
♪ ♪

390
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,675
-NINA: Hey, LeClerc.
-LeCLERC: What?

391
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,442
NINA: Did you see how much
Kincaid's paying us

392
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,344
-for this one?
-(chuckles)

393
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:06,213
-Oh, yeah. (chuckles)
-(laughs)

394
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,815
-We're in trouble.
-Hell yeah.

395
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,584
(radio beeps)

396
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:12,185
(static and distorted chatter
over radio)

397
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,256
KREBS:
Well, the good news is,

398
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,458
the Mosasaur was tagged
in captivity

399
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,428
and InGen continued to track it
after its escape.

400
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,330
We bought their data
when they entered Chapter 11,

401
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,632
so now we track it.

402
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,868
Nobody else seems to know
much about it.

403
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:28,836
But...

404
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,638
that's it right there.

405
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:34,307
So, first sample
in 150 miles or so.

406
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,978
Very close to the equator.

407
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,579
But why... why near the equator?

408
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:41,348
Why don't they survive
anywhere else?

409
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:45,218
The fitness landscape of
the Earth no longer suits them.

410
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,421
Uh, the air is different.

411
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:48,956
Uh, the solar radiation
is different,

412
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,692
the insects, vegetation.

413
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,292
Everything is different.

414
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,561
But close to the equator,

415
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:56,296
it's nearly the climate
of 60 million years ago.

416
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,965
It's warmer
and rich with oxygen.

417
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,735
And the Mosasaur
generally circles

418
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,302
the island
we're headed to.

419
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:05,305
There's a complex there
that was R and D

420
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,642
for the original park.

421
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:12,479
It was abandoned
after an accident.

422
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,450
We're gonna want to get in,
get our three samples

423
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:19,419
and get out
as quickly as possible.

424
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:20,788
Because even though
two dozen species

425
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:24,859
have survived there, alone,
for almost 20 years,

426
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:29,463
make no mistake, this is by no
means a controlled environment.

427
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:32,600
ATWATER: (chuckles)
Yeah, I think we'll be okay.

428
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,969
What are those?

429
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,004
ATWATER:
Neurotoxins.

430
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,506
ZORA:
How fast?

431
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:41,042
ATWATER: Paralysis within
a couple of seconds.

432
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,543
And then what?

433
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:46,379
And then you survive.

434
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,387
Is this the part where you, uh,

435
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,923
tell me it's a crime
to kill a dinosaur, Doctor?

436
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:59,761
No, this is where I tell you
it's a sin to kill a dinosaur.

437
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,796
(chuckles)

438
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:08,536
So, uh, what if
it's us or them? Hmm?

439
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:11,773
Then we've put ourselves in
a place where we don't belong.

440
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,508
(scoffs)

441
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,443
Mm, that's-that's kind of
our specialty, Dr. Loomis.

442
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:19,747
We have no intention
of harming the animals.

443
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:22,683
Let's just get our samples
and go home.

444
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:25,385
Gonna lose the light
before we make contact.

445
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,555
We'll make a run
first thing in the morning.

446
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,924
How does extraction work?

447
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,527
LOOMIS: These darts
collect blood samples.

448
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,795
You get one
shot with each.

449
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:35,495
The Mosa has
four inches of hide,

450
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,934
so you must be within
ten meters to penetrate.

451
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,937
And it self-ejects
when it reaches capacity.

452
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,106
-(dart beeping)
-It should fire

453
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:46,841
a couple of hundred feet
in the air,

454
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,408
like a model rocket.

455
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:53,548
On the day,
a parachute will open,

456
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:55,348
and it will float back down
to us.

457
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:56,818
I'll take the shot.

458
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:59,821
Uh, remote biopsy darting
is pretty basic.

459
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:01,589
I'm sure I can handle it.

460
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,558
Oh.

461
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:04,826
(laughs)

462
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,695
Let me show you something.

463
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,569
-You feel that spray?
-Yeah.

464
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:17,071
ZORA: Now imagine the boat
rocking at 15 to 20 degrees,

465
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,907
we're moving at 30 knots, you
got sweat running in your eyes,

466
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:23,778
and you're close enough to look
that thing right in the teeth.

467
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,345
You got this.

468
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,854
Uh, please, be my guest.

469
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:35,623
Oh, really? If you insist.

470
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,963
(Kincaid laughs)

471
00:22:41,996 --> 00:22:44,599
(laughing):
I can't take it.

472
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:46,000
-(Kincaid laughing)
-(radio beeping)

473
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,035
I mean, it's-it's been fun
working with you, Z.

474
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:51,471
-What? -But I think we
just found our new team leader.

475
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,007
(both laughing)

476
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,742
No offense.

477
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:57,845
I mean, I don't know anybody
that could be offended by that.

478
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,379
That's mean.

479
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:03,383
(Kincaid sighs)

480
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:06,754
I heard about Booker.

481
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:09,156
(inhales deeply)

482
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,992
(sighs) Yeah.

483
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,793
I'm so sorry.

484
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:15,428
Yeah.

485
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:18,933
-What job were you on?
-(sighs)

486
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:24,605
Um, just a simple
training mission in Yemen.

487
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:27,474
Couldn't have been more basic.
Just a car bomb.

488
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:30,477
Out of nowhere.

489
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,447
Quick at least.

490
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:38,819
Not really.

491
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,655
(sighs) Shit.

492
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:44,525
He didn't deserve that.

493
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,662
No.

494
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:49,429
(sighs)

495
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,667
I had to tell his wife.

496
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,902
It was... it was brutal.

497
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,704
You can't keep this up
forever, Z.

498
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:57,772
No.

499
00:23:57,805 --> 00:24:00,107
This work...

500
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,909
it breaks you eventually.

501
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:04,178
What do you think
I'm doing down here?

502
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:07,615
I'm just trying to,
you know, buy my life back.

503
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:10,151
Oh, really?
I thought you just missed me.

504
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,586
-Well...
-(chuckles)

505
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,088
You know what I actually missed?

506
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,489
Hmm?

507
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:17,992
My own mother's funeral.

508
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,061
Oh, wow.

509
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:21,529
Yeah.

510
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:23,230
That's terrible, Zora.

511
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:25,099
-Yeah, yeah.
-No, seriously.

512
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:27,268
That's, like, the worst thing
I've ever heard anybody do.

513
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,804
Thank you.
That's so supportive of you.

514
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:31,639
Oh.

515
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:34,508
God.

516
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:43,517
Please tell me
you worked it out with Amelia.

517
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,624
Well...

518
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:55,930
Whenever we looked
at each other, we just...

519
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:59,967
...just saw
our little boy.

520
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:06,040
Easier for us both just
to go at it alone, you know?

521
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,118
We are very pathetic.

522
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:19,020
(laughing)

523
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:21,956
All right, what do you say
we stay alive?

524
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:27,962
And, uh, you know,
get rich this time.

525
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:30,898
Rich is nice,
but it won't be enough.

526
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:32,733
For sure.

527
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:35,903
Do something that matters

You need sleep. I need sleep.

It's your shift, Xavier.
Come on, man.

578
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:43,230
Reuben, can't we just anchor,
for once?

579
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:46,167
Use the anchor.
We haven't done that yet.

We only carry 50 meters
of anchor chain.

should've thought about that

(bellowing)

880
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,534
We're losing her!

881
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,777
ZORA:
Loomis! I need you to secure me

882
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,779
-to the bow rail.
-LOOMIS: Okay.

883
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,515
ZORA:
Make it tight.

884
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:57,051
-Like this?
-Yeah.

885
00:41:58,285 --> 00:41:59,787
-The other side.
-Okay.

886
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:04,759
Remember, don't fire
until it's within ten meters.

887
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,127
ZORA:
Got it.

888
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:13,801
All right.

889
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:15,569
Nina, I need command
up here now.

890
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:17,705
(console beeping)

891
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:19,707
Comm is yours.

893
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,919
Come on. Come on!

894
00:42:31,952 --> 00:42:34,288
We got to be closer! Move it!

895
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,323
Hey. Get up here and spot.

896
00:42:36,357 --> 00:42:37,992
NINA (over radio):
On my way.

897
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:41,562
20 meters.

898
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:46,600
Almost in range!

899
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,607
15 meters.

900
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:54,909
Copy.

901
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,885
(groans):
Ah.

902

(bellowing)

903
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:17,364
-(groans)
-Another dart.

904
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:18,933
Okay.

905
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:22,736
Come on!

906
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:27,708
(Isabella whimpering)

907
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:31,712
(bellowing)

908
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:35,216
It's coming at us! Turn! Turn!

909
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,120
Quick! It's in range!

910
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:40,754
Come on!

911
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,164
There, go!

912
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,736

(growling)

915
00:43:58,772 --> 00:43:59,807
Hey! (grunts)

916
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,742
Help me up! Help me!

917
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:04,011

918
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:09,650
KREBS:
Come on!

919
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:15,990
Take the shot!

920
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:21,829
(dart beeping)

921
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:23,364

(shouts)

925
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:38,779
It worked!

926
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:41,916
Yes! Come down ten knots!

927
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:44,285
Hard starboard.
Down ten. Down ten.

928
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:49,356
NINA:
There it is!

929
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,458
Port side off the stern rail.

930
00:44:51,492 --> 00:44:53,827
(panting)

931
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:57,298
LOOMIS:
I got it! I got it!

932
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:03,971
(grunts)

933
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:09,243
-Nice shot.
-(chuckles)

934
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,478
Nice rocket.

935
00:45:11,513 --> 00:45:13,147
-That was fantastic.
-Yeah!

936
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,216
-(laughter)
-That was genius.

937
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:16,784
(conversing in French)

938
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:17,785
(laughter)

939
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,186
-Yes.
-That was good.

940
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,754
-That worked. That worked.
-(LeClerc speaking French)

941
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:22,223
LOOMIS:
Oh, God.

942
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:24,725
(excited chatter

943
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,328

946
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:38,239
-LOOMIS: Hey.
-ZORA: Hey.

947
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:40,007
What if we don't?

948
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,275
What if we don't what?

949
00:45:41,308 --> 00:45:42,876
Well, what if we get the samples

950
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,378
and we don't give them over
to a company

951
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:46,514
that makes a lifesaving drug
and then prices it

952
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:49,250
so 99% of the planet
can't afford it?

953
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:53,387
Science is for all of us,
not some of us.

954
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,122
Have you thought about that?

955
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:59,126
No, I guess I haven't.

956
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,996
Well, then maybe
you should start.

957
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:03,998
-Maybe you should stop.
-ISABELLA: Dad, please.

958
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,233
-(Xavier hyperventilating)
-REUBEN: Hey, Xavier.

959
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:08,302
Head between your legs,
deep breaths.

960
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:10,337
Hey. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

961
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:12,973
Dad, I think I'm gonna be sick.

962
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:14,475
It's all right. Just breathe.

963
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:17,011
(Isabella breathing heavily)

965
00:46:24,051 --> 00:46:25,953
TERESA:
Those things from the boat.

966
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:28,956
They're... they're-they're back.

967
00:46:36,096 --> 00:46:37,998
-Oh, my God.
-ISABELLA: Dad?

968
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:40,568
What the hell are those?

969
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:43,337
REUBEN:
Sit down, honey. Stay close.

970
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:47,107
Spinosaurus.

971
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:56,350
(laughs) It's mutualism!

972
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:57,985
(dinosaurs grunting)

973
00:46:58,018 --> 00:47:00,421
Interspecies symbiosis!

974
00:47:01,422 --> 00:47:03,157
Those Spinosaurus,

975
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,459
they help the Mosasaur hunt.

976
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,027
They help it kill!

977
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:10,632
-Well, that's discouraging.
-(gun racks)

978
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:12,299
(dinosaur grunts)

979
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:16,236
These are our waters now.

980
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:19,473

981
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:21,208

KINCAID:
Over here! There's another one!

983
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:28,215
KREBS: There! Seven o'clock!
Hurry! Quick!

984
00:47:28,248 --> 00:47:30,851
(gunfire)

985
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:35,155
Bobby. Bobby, Bobby.

986
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:36,990
-Look out!

991
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,972
Bobby! Bobby, no!

(grunting, screaming)

997
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:18,332
Dad! (screaming)

998
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:20,434
-Dad!
-Bella!

(whimpering) Dad!

1002
00:48:31,713 --> 00:48:34,148
(straining):
Oh, my God. Oh.

1003
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,296
KREBS: What are you doing?
You're heading into the rocks!

1004
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,165
KINCAID:
I can outrun those things.

1005
00:48:51,198 --> 00:48:53,967
The Mosasaur can't go
into shallow water.

1006
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:56,571
(bellowing)

1007
00:48:56,604 --> 00:48:58,939
Everybody, hold on to something!

1008
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:00,742
(pained groaning)

1009
00:49:00,775 --> 00:49:04,211
-I can't move my leg, honey.
-(crying)

1010
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:08,982
If we hit those rocks,
we're gonna wreck.

1011
00:49:09,016 --> 00:49:10,984
Tie these
to everything you need.

1012
00:49:11,018 --> 00:49:12,486
Be ready to jump.

1013
00:49:14,488 --> 00:49:16,524
(bellowing)

1014
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:21,261
It's fast.

1015
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:23,464
LeClerc,
the engine's overheating.

1016
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:31,138
Teresa, get back inside.
Get on the radio.

1017
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:33,173
Mayday three times
and send coordinates. Go!

1018
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:34,642
Three times, send coordinates.
Got it.

1019
00:49:34,676 --> 00:49:37,177
REUBEN:
Hang on, honey.

1020
00:49:37,946 --> 00:49:39,747
Isabella.
Isabella, hey, look at me.

1021
00:49:39,781 --> 00:49:41,081
It's gonna be
okay. Listen.

Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

1024
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:45,720
-Okay. Hang on. Hey, hey, hey.
-Is anybody there?

1025
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:46,788
-Mayday! Mayday!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.

1026
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:48,222
-Please! Hey!
-Stop.

1027
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:50,190
Just stop. Stop for a second.

1028
00:49:50,224 --> 00:49:51,492
What do you mean, "stop"?

1029
00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:52,660
(chuckles): W-We got
to handle this ourselves.

1030
00:49:52,694 --> 00:49:54,127
-What?
-This is the...

1031
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,763
-This is the protocol.
-Are you crazy?

1032
00:49:55,797 --> 00:49:57,364
-No! Mayday. No. No, no, no.
-Just give me the... Hey.

00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:01,134
Back off! (grunts)

Please help me.

Please. Help me, please.

1038

Please.

1039

Please help me.

1040
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:17,251
Grab my hand, please.

1041
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:19,052

No!

Man overboard!

1051
00:50:41,576 --> 00:50:43,176
Listen to me.
We're going in the water now.

1052
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,779
Yes. The boat's gonna crash.

1053
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:46,280
We have to. Your sister's there.

1054

-You understand? Hey. Hey.
-(whimpering)

1055

Hey. I'm here. Okay?

1056
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:51,285
All right? I've got you.
