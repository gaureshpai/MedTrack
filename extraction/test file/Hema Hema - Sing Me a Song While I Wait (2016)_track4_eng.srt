00:03:06,574 --> 00:03:10,204
[Add appropriate subtitle text here]


2
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:57,106
Consider yourself dead.

3
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,357
You are here to prepare for the gap
between birth and death.

4
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:23,835
You have no identity.

5
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:03,340
On No Moon you will be reborn.

6
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:26,866
You do not need to speak.

7
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,765
Just nod or shake your head.

8
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:39,403
Is this your first time?

9
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:44,808
How did you know here?

10
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:56,124
I see.

11
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,858
They will show you to your tent.

12
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:23,085
Our last guest has arrived

13
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,287
so the boundary is now closed.

14
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,898
Today is the Full Moon.

15
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:39,938
None of you will leave until No Moon.

16
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:31,883
You want to remain unknown.

17
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:37,624
That's why you all wear masks and skirts.

18
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:44,337
You don't even want other people to know
your gender.

19
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:47,999
It's your own decision.

20
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:07,651
You are here to find out who you
really are.

21
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:14,560
You are all here to find out what you
would do if you were not known.

22
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:20,368
This only happens once every twelve
years, so don't waste this opportunity.

23
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:26,379
So don't waste this opportunity.

24
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:33,384
Do whatever you need

25
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:38,926
to hide your identity and gender.

26
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:51,663
I know you all.

27
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:59,174
I have selected each one of you.

28
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,273
No one else knows who you are.

29
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:11,256
But there may be people who get a thrill

30
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:15,352
from finding out who you are.

31
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:18,454
Similarly, there will be some of you who
might get a thrill

32
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:23,093
from finding out who others are.

33
00:16:51,064 --> 00:16:54,125
Anonymity is power.

34
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:58,262
If you give away your identity,

35
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,069
you give away your power.

36
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:25,359
There may also be people who already
know you

37
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:32,201
or who have an axe to grind with you.

38
00:17:32,306 --> 00:17:38,609
They may take this opportunity to harm
you.

39
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:10,607
Being anonymous is intoxicating.

40
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:16,582
It brings out the reckless side of
people.

41
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:22,588
So be careful now and the rest of your
life.

42
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:28,856
Always watch your backs.

43
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:33,360
Your masks are your temporary identity

44
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:36,528
but they also protect you.

45
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:43,373
Your power is that you are unknown.

46
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:51,477
If you are in danger here, blow your
whistle.

47
00:18:57,524 --> 00:19:05,524
But there is also a ceremony to
celebrate life and death.

48
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:13,173
So, we have dances, parties and plays.

49
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:18,803
They can happen anytime. There is no
fixed time.

50
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:26,912
If you decide to go out of our boundary
before we are finished,

51
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:34,887
you can't come back, now or ever.

52
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:42,226
I know some of you will break the rules.

53
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:45,270
If you do, you will be unmasked

54
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:48,273
and your identity will be known by all.

55
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:54,178
You will be haunted for the rest of
your lives.

56
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:56,773
If you do something really grave,

57
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:59,545
we will make you disappear

58
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:07,653
and no one will ever know because no
one knows you're here.

59
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:16,225
The guards and I will be watching over
you.

60
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:21,506
This man was caught rummaging through
another's belongings.

61
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:27,876
We shall decide what we will do with him
before No Moon.

62
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,942
But for now, we will have to lock him up

63
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:41,084
because he may know some of your
identities.

64
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:29,060
Announcing the first act! Come everyone!

65
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:39,471
<i>[Correct subtitle text needed - appears to be garbled]</i>

66
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:46,642
Commencing immediately on the main stage!

67
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:54,365
Listen to me

68
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:05,410
The death that you fear most has come.

69
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:43,448
Fear not death, but be afraid of birth.

70
00:36:48,828 --> 00:36:54,767
You are in the bardo.

71
00:36:54,867 --> 00:37:00,203
You are on the border of death and birth.

72
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:05,472
You are alone here.

73
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:09,981
If you hear me,

74
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:19,419
it's your mind hearing it.

75
00:37:19,525 --> 00:37:24,861
Even though you are dead, your mind's
ear will hear me talking to you

76
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:32,428
Even though you are dead, your mind's
ear will hear me talking to you.

77
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:40,538
Your eyes, ears, tongue, nose and body
have left you.

78
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:51,946
You will also hear your relatives crying.

79
00:37:52,057 --> 00:37:57,427
Let go of them.

80
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:05,530
They don't know how to let go of you.

81
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:19,882
Your soul will be in the Bardo realm

82
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:23,512
It's uncertain how long you will linger
here.

83
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,063
Listen,

84
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:50,039
In the presence of the Lord of Death

85
00:39:50,142 --> 00:39:53,043
in the court of the Netherworld,

86
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:58,743
you will be judged.

87
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:13,596
Today you will be judged.

88
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:17,727
Have you deprived anyone of life?

89
00:40:17,836 --> 00:40:20,931
Have you taken things that are not given?

90
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,672
Have you raped body or mind of others?

91
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:40,618
And now the Snake will see with his dice.

92
00:41:08,153 --> 00:41:13,216
Oh you, have you seduced your mother?

93
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:16,620
Have you chewed and swallowed your
daughter?

94
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:19,721
Have you raped your father?

95
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:29,033
And now the pig will look at his mirror
and see everything.

96
00:41:44,156 --> 00:41:49,117
Do not hide your negative actions, you
must confess.

97
00:41:49,228 --> 00:41:51,629
Yes, you are hiding something!

98
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:59,768
Yes, you have let a whole family suffer
on earth.

99
00:41:59,872 --> 00:42:04,742
Pig can see it.

100
00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:08,211
What did you do?

101
00:42:08,313 --> 00:42:12,682
You had better confess before we find
out,

102
00:42:12,785 --> 00:42:19,589
or else you will also be judged as a
liar,

103
00:42:19,691 --> 00:42:22,922
and the repercussions will be graver yet.

104
00:42:26,832 --> 00:42:30,029
“Wait!”

105
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:32,934
Says the White Goddess

106
00:42:43,315 --> 00:42:51,315
There must be one thing he has done
right.

107
00:42:53,625 --> 00:43:01,625
Now, Monkey will weigh his deeds.

108
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:52,840
The White Goddess urges the dead man to
confess:

109
00:44:52,945 --> 00:44:56,245
'You must confess. It's all your mind,

110
00:44:56,348 --> 00:45:01,013
you are confessing to your own mind.'

111
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:09,119
'He must have done at least a few good
things in his past lives.'

112
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:59,522
Nothing is predestined.

113
00:47:59,631 --> 00:48:07,300
Nothing is free will.

114
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:15,406
There are no accidents.

115
00:48:48,947 --> 00:48:53,976
Come OH.

116
00:48:54,085 --> 00:48:59,182
Okay... but you go first.

117
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:33,455
Plant rice, rice will grow.

118
00:53:33,565 --> 00:53:40,301
Plant barley, barley will grow.

119
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:37,521
Plant rice, rice will grow.

120
00:54:41,566 --> 00:54:49,566
Plant barley, barley will grow.

121
00:54:51,376 --> 00:54:59,376
Plant negative actions,

122
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:10,520
suffering will grow.

123
00:55:24,876 --> 00:55:28,835
Is that all you could find?

124
00:55:28,947 --> 00:55:32,975
Me, I had to go into the mask room.

125
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:36,748
You look so funny!

126
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:41,453
What is it? Why aren't you saying
anything?

127
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:46,495
Hey, who are you?

128
00:55:46,598 --> 00:55:48,532
I asked who are you.

129
00:55:53,504 --> 00:55:55,370
Who are you?

130
00:55:55,473 --> 00:55:56,998
Answer me

131
00:55:57,108 --> 00:55:58,769
What are you doing?

132
00:56:01,579 --> 00:56:02,774
Let me go!

133
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:05,782
I said let me go!

134
00:59:51,976 --> 00:59:59,976
Oh, Noble one. Fear not death,

135
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:17,961
for you are already dead.

136
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:24,160
This evening, someone was killed.

137
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:30,861
Be careful, the killer is among us,

138
01:02:30,968 --> 01:02:37,499
we may not know who did this.

139
01:02:37,808 --> 01:02:44,805
Even if we know we are bound by our oath
never to reveal identities.

140
01:02:44,915 --> 01:02:48,044
But I want to tell the killer

141
01:02:48,152 --> 01:02:55,923
that your own conscience will haunt you
forever.

142
01:02:56,027 --> 01:03:04,027
For now, we will offer him the finest
funeral of our custom.

143
01:03:58,322 --> 01:04:06,322
You won't have a shadow. Nor will you
have a footprint.

144
01:04:06,564 --> 01:04:11,126
You may have made your way back to your
home, but no one is speaking to you,

145
01:04:11,235 --> 01:04:19,235
but no one is speaking to you,
because no one sees you.

146
01:04:22,646 --> 01:04:30,646
Do not scream, for no one hears.

147
01:04:59,216 --> 01:05:07,216
You have awoken from the dream of this
life.

148
01:05:14,999 --> 01:05:22,999
You will soon slip into the dream of the
next life.

149
01:05:30,548 --> 01:05:38,548
We hope it will be a shining one.

150
01:06:13,657 --> 01:06:21,462
You have been stripped of the apparel of
this body.

151
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:29,370
Aim for a good one for the next life.

152
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:37,575
For now, you are naked,

153
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:45,681
this is not a moment to be wasted.

154
01:06:50,294 --> 01:06:57,360
Being naked is precious.

155
01:06:57,468 --> 01:07:05,468
Avoid looking back when you hear the
cries of your loved ones.

156
01:07:10,414 --> 01:07:18,414
Be not in haste to choose the next
companions or home.

157
01:07:30,768 --> 01:07:38,768
All what you see and hear, you see and
hear

158
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:47,710
because you looked and listened.

159
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:57,119
You are your own master.

160
01:08:02,733 --> 01:08:10,606
You are your own architect.

161
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:16,272
You are your own ferryman.

162
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:22,251
You are the boat, you are the oars.

163
01:08:22,353 --> 01:08:30,353
Do not be disheartened by the horizon of
the infinite ocean of life,

164
01:08:33,631 --> 01:08:41,631
for the horizon is here and now.

165
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:07,443
24 YEARS LATER, YEAR OF THE FIRE MONKEY

166
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:39,771
Have you been here before?

167
01:12:44,047 --> 01:12:46,914
Twelve years ago, is it?

168
01:12:53,557 --> 01:12:55,651
Oh. You're an oldie

169
01:12:55,759 --> 01:12:58,023
Do you remember the rules?

170
01:12:58,128 --> 01:13:04,795
Hey, times have changed but the rules
are mostly the same.

171
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:12,866
We don't know you. You don't know us.

172
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,876
No one knows each other here,

173
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:17,037
and that's your power.

174
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:25,147
Your father or mother, could also be
here.

175
01:13:25,589 --> 01:13:28,923
But, of course, you wouldn't know.

176
01:13:29,026 --> 01:13:37,026
So, I suggest you don't go pinching
anyone's bottom.

177
01:13:39,069 --> 01:13:41,663
Understand?

178
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:11,587
You have been dead for a long time.

179
01:15:20,971 --> 01:15:28,971
Now you will forget your name.

180
01:15:31,048 --> 01:15:38,887
Old friends and family mean nothing now.

181
01:15:38,989 --> 01:15:45,224
You will be famished for different foods

182
01:15:45,328 --> 01:15:53,328
and long for different nests.

183
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:08,110
You have been dead for a long time.

184
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:18,220
Now you will forget your name.

185
01:16:20,263 --> 01:16:28,193
Old friends and family mean nothing now.

186
01:16:37,147 --> 01:16:41,880
You will be famished for different foods

187
01:16:41,985 --> 01:16:49,187
and long for different nests.

188
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:09,705
Agay.

189
01:17:10,981 --> 01:17:12,005
Agay.

190
01:17:16,653 --> 01:17:18,621
What?

191
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:22,882
What's happening?

192
01:17:22,993 --> 01:17:26,930
A tent caught on fire. Nothing to worry
about.

193
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:29,021
But Agay... listen to me.

194
01:17:29,132 --> 01:17:35,094
Have you ever raped someone?

195
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:38,806
What?!

196
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:41,970
Who is this?!

197
01:17:42,078 --> 01:17:44,877
Are you going crazy?

198
01:17:44,981 --> 01:17:50,215
Crazy? I have been crazy for 24 years.

199
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,721
Get out!

200
01:17:52,822 --> 01:17:57,419
I'll call the guards.

201
01:18:12,175 --> 01:18:14,234
Go ahead.

202
01:18:14,344 --> 01:18:15,709
Blow your horn.

203
01:18:15,812 --> 01:18:18,110
I left a note in my home,

204
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:25,417
that if do not return in several days,
I have been murdered by you.

205
01:18:25,722 --> 01:18:27,713
Wait...

206
01:18:27,824 --> 01:18:28,689
Calm down

207
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:45,469
Tell me where she is?

208
01:18:45,775 --> 01:18:48,369
You know the rules.

209
01:18:48,478 --> 01:18:52,881
To hell with your rules!

210
01:18:54,484 --> 01:18:58,250
Why do you want to know?

211
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,459
Wait...

212
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:12,094
Did you rape her?

213
01:19:13,203 --> 01:19:16,901
I never knew a momentary incident would
affect my whole life.

214
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:19,942
Think twice before you show your face.

215
01:19:31,121 --> 01:19:37,891
My life was finished a long time ago.

216
01:19:37,994 --> 01:19:45,994
I have nothing to lose, I have no face.

217
01:20:02,018 --> 01:20:07,286
Oh, now I know,

218
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:10,883
You also killed her husband too

219
01:20:10,994 --> 01:20:13,224
didn't you?

220
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:19,066
I have been searching for her everywhere.

221
01:20:21,104 --> 01:20:24,802
Tell me where she is.

222
01:20:26,476 --> 01:20:28,570
Where is she?

223
01:20:33,983 --> 01:20:38,420
She's dead.

224
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:45,928
She died giving birth to a daughter.

225
01:20:52,969 --> 01:20:54,596
Are you saying...

226
01:20:54,904 --> 01:20:59,273
She may be yours...

227
01:20:59,376 --> 01:21:04,109
Maybe not.

228
01:21:07,283 --> 01:21:10,947
Where is the girl?

229
01:24:55,545 --> 01:24:59,573
How much do you make?

230
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:07,222
How much do you make?

231
01:25:18,735 --> 01:25:21,705
What if...

232
01:25:21,804 --> 01:25:26,571
you didn't have to work here?

233
01:25:30,146 --> 01:25:36,108
I mean... what if you didn't have to
work here?

234
01:25:39,322 --> 01:25:44,260
What? Will you take care of me?

235
01:25:54,437 --> 01:25:57,498
Wait for me.

236
01:26:45,655 --> 01:26:50,786
